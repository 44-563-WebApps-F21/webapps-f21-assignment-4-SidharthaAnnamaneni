            ACT II<br>
            <br>

                                  SCENE

_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
_A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.<br>

DUKE<br>

   No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
   Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.

MAFFIO [_excitedly_]

   Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
   Who every moment grow more clamorous.

DUKE

   Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
   People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
   The only men I fear are silent men.<br>

                                               [_A yell from the people_.]

   You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.

                                                         [_Another yell_.]

   Go, Petrucci,
   And tell the captain of the guard below
   To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
   Do what I bid you.

                                                        [_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]

CARDINAL

   I beseech your Grace
   To listen to their grievances.

DUKE [_sitting on his throne_]

   Ay! the peaches
   Are not so big this year as they were last.
   I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
   I thought you spake of peaches.

                                              [_A cheer from the people_.]

   What is that?

GUIDO [_rushes to the window_]

   The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
   And stands between the people and the guard,
   And will not let them shoot.

DUKE

   The devil take her!

GUIDO [_still at the window_]

   And followed by a dozen of the citizens
   Has come into the Palace.<br>
