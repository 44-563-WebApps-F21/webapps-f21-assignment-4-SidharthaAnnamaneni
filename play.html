                                  SCENE  

_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
_A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.<br> </h3>

<h4 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h4>
   <p class="speech>">No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!
   Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.</p>

<h4 class="name MAFFIO">MAFFIO</h4> 
<p class="stage-direction">[_excitedly_]</p>
<p class = "speech"> Your Grace, there are two thousand people there
   Who every moment grow more clamorous.</p>

<h4 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h4>

<p class = "speech">Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!
   People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;
   The only men I fear are silent men.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[_A yell from the people_.]</p>
<p class = "speech">  You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.</p>
<p class="stage-direction">[_Another yell_.]</p>

   <p class = "speech">Go, Petrucci,
   And tell the captain of the guard below
   To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?
   Do what I bid you.</p>
   <p class="stage-direction">[_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]</p>

<h4 class="name CARDINAL">CARDINAL</h4>

  <p class = "speech"> I beseech your Grace
   To listen to their grievances.</p>

<h4 class="name DUKE">DUKE</h4>
<p class="stage-direction">[_sitting on his throne_]</p>

   <p class = "speech">Ay! the peaches
   Are not so big this year as they were last.
   I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,
   I thought you spake of peaches.</p>
   <p class="stage-direction">[_A cheer from the people_.]</p>

  <p class = "speech"> What is that?</p>

<h4 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO</h4> 
<p class="stage-direction">[_rushes to the window_]</p>

  <p class = "speech"> The Duchess has gone forth into the square,
   And stands between the people and the guard,
   And will not let them shoot.</p>

<h4 class="name DUKE" >DUKE</h4>

   <p class = "speech">The devil take her!</p>

<h4 class="name GUIDO">GUIDO</h4> 
<p class="stage-direction">[_still at the window_]</p>

  <p class = "speech"> And followed by a dozen of the citizens
   Has come into the Palace.</p>
